# Project_Website 

Hello World! ðŸŒŽ

Hi, my name is Christian Martinez. I recently completed the ASU Coding Bootcamp, where one of our first projects was to build and deploy a website. Throughout the process, we acquired valuable skills, including setting up a Virtual Private Server (VPS), configuring a Virtual Network, and managing firewall rules â€” all of which Iâ€™ll explain in more detail later in this guide.

After setting up the network, we built everything from scratch on a plain Ubuntu server.
But enough of the background â€” letâ€™s dive into the good stuff: setting up a website on a VPS!

Step 1: Create an Account with a Cloud Provider
First things first, you'll need to create an account with a cloud service provider.
Here are some popular options:

[Digital Ocean](https://github.com/Chrismrt76/Project_Website/blob/main/DigitalOcean)
âž” Add a credit card and receive $200 in free credits for 60 days.

[Amazon AWS](https://github.com/Chrismrt76/Project_Website/blob/main/Amazon%20Web%20Services%20(AWS))
âž” Get 12 months of free tier services, plus some always-free services.

[Microsoft Azure](https://github.com/Chrismrt76/Project_Website/blob/main/Microsoft%20Azure)
âž” Receive $200 in free credits for 30 days, plus free services for 12 months.

[Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://github.com/Chrismrt76/Project_Website/blob/main/Google%20Cloud%20Platform%20(GCP))
âž” Receive $300 in free credits valid for 90 days.


Why I Chose AWS
I personally began my VPS journey with Amazon AWS due to its generous free tier and extensive range of services.
However, you can start with whichever provider suits you best!

Important Note:
If youâ€™re following along and choose a different provider, be aware that naming conventions and setup steps might differ slightly.
If there's enough interest, Iâ€™ll create detailed guides for setting up on Digital Ocean, Azure, and GCP as well â€” leave a comment!
