# Project_Website
Personal/Blog Website

            This platform serves as the central hub for my digital presence, housing my website and showcasing a curated selection of my projects. Leveraging my proficiency in AWS, I've implemented LightSail and Rout 53 to ensure optimal performance and reliability. MariaDB serves as the backbone of the web infrastructure, seamlessly integrated with WordPress to unify and streamline the website's functionalities.
